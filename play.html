        </h4>
       
            <h5 class="LADYCAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE.</h5>  <p class="speech">That is a very wonderful opening for so young a man as
            you are, Mr. Arbuthnot.</p><br>
            
            <h5 class ="GERALD">GERALD.</h5>  <p class="speech">It is indeed, Lady Caroline.  I trust I shall be able to show
            myself worthy of it.</p><br>
            
            <h5 class="LADYCAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE.</h5> <p class="speech"> I trust so.</p><br>
            
            <h5 class ="GERALD">GERALD.</h5> <p class="SD1">[_To_ HESTER.]</p> <p class="speech"> _You_ have not congratulated me yet, Miss
            Worsley.</p><br>
            
            <h5 class ="HESTER">HESTER.</h5>  <p class="speech">Are you very pleased about it?</p><br>
            
            <h5 class ="GERALD">GERALD.</h5> <p class="speech"> Of course I am.  It means everything to me—things that were out
            of the reach of hope before may be within hope’s reach now.</p><br>
            
            <h5 class ="HESTER">HESTER.</h5> <p class="speech">Nothing should be out of the reach of hope.Life is a hope.</p><br>
            
            <h5 class="LADYHUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h5> <p class="speech">I fancy, Caroline, that Diplomacy is what Lord
            Illingworth is aiming at.  I heard that he was offered Vienna.  But that
            may not be true.</p><br>
            
            <h5 class="LADYCAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE.</h5><p class="speech"> I don’t think that England should be represented abroad
            by an unmarried man, Jane.  It might lead to complications.</p><br>
            
            <h5 class="LADYHUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h5>  <p class="speech">You are too nervous, Caroline.  Believe me, you are too
            nervous.  Besides, Lord Illingworth may marry any day.  I was in hopes he
            would have married lady Kelso.  But I believe he said her family was too
            large.  Or was it her feet?  I forget which.  I regret it very much.  She
            was made to be an ambassador’s wife.</p><br>
            
            <h5 class="LADYCAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE.</h5> <p class="speech"> She certainly has a wonderful faculty of remembering
            people’s names, and forgetting their faces.</p><br>
            
            <h5 class="LADYHUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h5>  <p class="speech">Well, that is very natural, Caroline, is it not?</p>  <p class="SD1">[_To
            Footman_.]</p> <p class="speech">  Tell Henry to wait for an answer.  I have written a line to
            your dear mother, Gerald, to tell her your good news, and to say she
            really must come to dinner.</p><br>
            
            <p class="SD1">[_Exit Footman_.]</p><br>
            
            <h5 class ="GERALD">GERALD.</h5>  <p class="speech">That is awfully kind of you, Lady Hunstanton.</p>  <p class="SD1">[_To_ HESTER.]</p>
            <p class="speech">Will you come for a stroll, Miss Worsley?</p><br>
            
            <h5 class ="HESTER">HESTER.</h5>  <p class="speech">With pleasure.</p>  <p class="SD1">[_Exit with_ GERALD.]</p><br>
            
            <h5 class="LADYHUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h5>  <p class="speech">I am very much gratified at Gerald Arbuthnot’s good
            fortune.  He is quite a _protégé_ of mine.  And I am particularly pleased
            that Lord Illingworth should have made the offer of his own accord
            without my suggesting anything.  Nobody likes to be asked favours.  I
            remember poor Charlotte Pagden making herself quite unpopular one season,
            because she had a French governess she wanted to recommend to every one.</p><br>
            
            <h5 class="LADYCAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE.</h5>  <p class="speech">I saw the governess, Jane.  Lady Pagden sent her to me.
            It was before Eleanor came out.  She was far too good-looking to be in
            any respectable household.  I don’t wonder Lady Pagden was so anxious to
            get rid of her.</p><br>
            
            <h5 class="LADYHUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h5>  <p class="speech">Ah, that explains it.</p><br>
            
            <h5 class="LADYCAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE.</h5>  <p class="speech"> John, the grass is too damp for you.  You had better go
            and put on your overshoes at once.</p><br>
            
            <h5 class = "SIRJOHN">SIR JOHN.</h5>  <p class="speech">I am quite comfortable, Caroline, I assure you.</p><br>
            
            <h5 class="LADYCAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE.</h5>  <p class="speech">You must allow me to be the best judge of that, John.
            Pray do as I tell you.</p><br>
            
            <p class="SD1">[SIR JOHN _gets up and goes off_.]</p><br>
            
            <h5 class="LADYHUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h5>  <p class="speech">You spoil him, Caroline, you do indeed!</p><br>
            
            <p class="SD1">[_Enter_ MRS. ALLONBY _and_ LADY STUTFIELD.]</p><br>
            
            <p class="SD1">[_To_ MRS. ALLONBY.]</p>  <p class="speech">Well, dear, I hope you like the park.  It is said
            to be well timbered.</p><br>
            
            <h5 class ="MRSALLONBY">MRS. ALLONBY.</h5> <p class="speech"> The trees are wonderful, Lady Hunstanton.</p><br>
            
            <h5 class="LADYSTUTFIELD">LADY STUTFIELD.</h5>  <p class="speech">Quite, quite wonderful.</p><br>
            
            <h5 class ="MRSALLONBY">MRS. ALLONBY.</h5>  <p class="speech">But somehow, I feel sure that if I lived in the country
            for six months, I should become so unsophisticated that no one would take
            the slightest notice of me.</p><br>
            
            <h5 class="LADYHUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h5>  <p class="speech">I assure you, dear, that the country has not that
            effect at all.  Why, it was from Melthorpe, which is only two miles from
            here, that Lady Belton eloped with Lord Fethersdale.  I remember the
            occurrence perfectly.  Poor Lord Belton died three days afterwards of
            joy, or gout.  I forget which.  We had a large party staying here at the
            time, so we were all very much interested in the whole affair.</p><br>
            
            <h5 class ="MRSALLONBY">MRS. ALLONBY.</h5>  <p class="speech"> I think to elope is cowardly.  It’s running away from
            danger.  And danger has become so rare in modern life.</p><br>
            
            <h5 class="LADYCAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE.</h5>  <p class="speech">As far as I can make out, the young women of the present
            day seem to make it the sole object of their lives to be always playing
            with fire.</p><br>
            
            <h5 class ="MRSALLONBY">MRS. ALLONBY.</h5>  <p class="speech">The one advantage of playing with fire, Lady Caroline, is
            that one never gets even singed.  It is the people who don’t know how to
            play with it who get burned up.</p><br>
            
            <h5 class="LADYSTUTFIELD">LADY STUTFIELD.</h5>  <p class="speech">Yes; I see that.  It is very, very helpful.</p><br>
            
            <h5 class="LADYHUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h5>  <p class="speech">I don’t know how the world would get on with such a
            theory as that, dear Mrs. Allonby.</p><br>
            
            <h5 class="LADYSTUTFIELD">LADY STUTFIELD.</h5>  <p class="speech">Ah!  The world was made for men and not for women.</p><br>
            
            <h5 class ="MRSALLONBY">MRS. ALLONBY.</h5>  <p class="speech">Oh, don’t say that, Lady Stutfield.  We have a much better
            time than they have.  There are far more things forbidden to us than are
            forbidden to them.</p><br>
            
            <h5 class="LADYSTUTFIELD">LADY STUTFIELD.</h5>  <p class="speech">Yes; that is quite, quite true.  I had not thought of
            that.</p><br>
            
            <p class="SD1">[_Enter_ SIR JOHN _and_ MR. KELVIL.]</p><br>
            
            <h5 class="LADYHUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h5>  <p class="speech">Well, Mr. Kelvil, have you got through your work?</p><br>
            
            <h5 class="KELVIL">KELVIL.</h5>  <p class="speech">I have finished my writing for the day, Lady Hunstanton.  It has
            been an arduous task.  The demands on the time of a public man are very
            heavy nowadays, very heavy indeed.  And I don’t think they meet with
            adequate recognition.</p><br>
            
            <h5 class="LADYCAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE.</h5>  <p class="speech">John, have you got your overshoes on?</p><br>
